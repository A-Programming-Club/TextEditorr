# User greeting and prompting

You will accomplish the following:
- Optionally greet the user
- Prompt the user to either open an existing file somewhere on the machine or create a new one
- Return something descriptive that tells what choice the user made
- You will also implement the functionality to open a file (but not read or write to that file)
- Make sure to validate all user input

## Currently Optional
- Make choices case-insensitive (if applicable). That is, if the user can enter the character `'a'` for a given choice, also let them enter `'A'`
